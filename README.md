‏About a month ago, we started learning the “Python” programming language, and then we got the robot to start experimenting with it. On the first day of testing the robot, we encountered some problems, such as turning on and off the robot, in addition to some software faults that were resolved after that, and we relied on algorithms in programming and the programming signal was To the robot (by moving the robot forward and then to the right and ending its cycle by rotating the entire circuit), the components of the robot
‏1- camera
‏2- battery
‏3- power bank
‏4- 2 Motors
‏5- Raspberrypi
‏6-bridge
‏7- A piece of plastic was placed to install the "respberrypi, bridge"

‏Under the direction and supervision of, Ahmed Matar, researcher and specialist in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence

‏On the days of the competition on October 1 and October 2, the programming was written and then the robot was tested in the ring. However, we encountered technical malfunctions such as he was outside the ring and also not walking on the right track, but all the problems and malfunctions were solved, and all that and with Solving problems and errors, we faced a greater problem, which is the time. The time was very, very tight. We almost finished one problem and the other appeared to us.

‏And in the end, the experience of “Wro the Future of Engineers” is one of the best competitions in the UAE because it teaches us how to become engineers in the future. With great thanks and appreciation to all of you, the competition management
